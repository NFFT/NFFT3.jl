# About


## Prof. Potts
The NFFT is a C subroutine library for computing the nonequispaced discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of complex data. New: A Matlab interface is part of the NFFT3. We believe that our library, which is free software, and based on FFTW (FFTW 3.x) should become the NFFT library of choice for most applications.

The NFFT package has been developed at the Mathematical Institute of the University of L\"ubeck, at the Mathematical Institute of the University Osnabr\"uck and at the Faculty of Mathematics of the Chemnitz University of Technology by Jens Keiner, Stefan Kunis and Daniel Potts. Further contributions, in particular applications, are due to Dr. Markus Fenn, Steffen Klatt, Tobias Knopp and Antje Vollrath. The support for OpenMP was developed by Toni Volkmer. Many contributions to the release 3.3.* and later are done by Toni Volkmer and Michael Quellmalz.

## Ronny
Manopt.jl inherited its name from [Manopt](https://manopt.org), a Matlab toolbox.
It is currently Maintained by [Ronny Bergmann](https://ronnybergmann.net/about.html) (manopt@ronnybergmann.net) with contributions from Tom Christian Riemer, who implemented the [trust regions](@ref trust_regions) solver.
